-FIRST FULLY WORKING AND USEFUL VERSION!!

-Added many functions to debugReadingFunctions. 
-scaleDebugScreen inputs a screenshot (and gui scale and monitor size) and then scales down the pixels to a 1:1 ratio (effectively changing gui scale) and also filters out noise.
-readProcessedScreen inputs an output from scaleDebugScreen and reads off coordinates and facing values from the screenshot.

-mcfont.py includes a binary array of each number in the minecraft font. 

-speedrunAssist.py is the header file and calls functions from all the modules. it is also the interface.

-strongholdCalculations.py was revised from an interface to an i/o function for speedrunAssist.py. If you want to just use the calculator either do it manually with the function or use the previous initial version.
